# 折草记

## 楔子

When I am at home, I always find myself drawn to the quiet corners, the places where the shadows lengthen and the world outside seems to fade away. It is in these moments of stillness that I feel most myself, most at peace. The raw text that follows is a collection of these quiet observations, fragmented thoughts, and fleeting emotions. It is a reflection of the inner landscape, a garden where weeds and wildflowers alike are allowed to grow.

> The world outside may roar and rage, but here, in the sanctuary of my own mind, there is only the gentle rustling of leaves and the soft murmur of a hidden stream.

This is not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It is a tapestry woven from moments, threads of feeling, and wisps of memory. Each entry is a breath, a sigh, a fleeting glimpse into the human condition.

*   The scent of rain on dry earth.
*   The weight of unspoken words.
*   The echo of laughter in an empty room.

## 浮生若梦

There are days when the veil between the mundane and the magical seems to thin, allowing glimpses of a reality that is both familiar and utterly alien. It is as if the ordinary world is merely a stage, and behind it, a grander, more profound drama unfolds.

*   I recall a moment, bathed in the golden light of late afternoon, when the air seemed to hum with an unseen energy. The leaves on the trees whispered secrets, and the clouds overhead painted ephemeral masterpieces across the sky.
*   At such times, the boundaries of self dissolve, and I feel a profound connection to all that is. The joy of a bird in flight, the resilience of a blade of grass pushing through concrete, the silent wisdom of an ancient tree – all of it becomes a part of me.

## 刹那芳华

Life, in its relentless march, is like a river, constantly flowing, constantly changing. We are but travelers on its currents, our destinies shaped by its ebb and flow. Yet, within this ceaseless motion, there are moments of breathtaking beauty, instants of pure, unadulterated existence that linger long after they have passed.

> We are but ripples on the surface of eternity, yet each ripple, however small, carries within it the essence of the ocean.

I try to capture these moments, to hold them close, like fireflies in a jar, their light a testament to the ephemeral magic of being. But like fireflies, they are elusive, their glow fading as quickly as it appears.

## 归去来兮

And so, the journey continues. The river flows on, carrying us towards an unknown sea. But even as we are swept along, we carry with us the echoes of the past, the whispers of the present, and the faint hope of a future yet to be written.

This is not an ending, but a pause. A moment to reflect, to breathe, and to prepare for whatever lies beyond the bend in the river.
